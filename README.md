Thesis title: Predicting Rural Hospital Closures with Machine Learning

Basic Information
This repository is used for keeping all codes for my Master's individual project. 
The main purpose of the project is to identify the best ML model for predicting RHCs. 

Essentail Installation

You may be required to install packages imblearn and xgboost when you run the code here.

For Mac OS users, simply go to terminal, run: 

$ pip install imblearn
$ pip install xgboost

For Windows users, open the command prompt with cmd, run:

$ pip install imblearn
$ pip install xgboost

Repository Structure

1. README
2. datasets.csv (It includes all data collected by myself for all observations)

The following 5 implementations were done with 5 different imputation methods: 

3. mean_implementation.ipynb
4. median_implementation.ipynb
5. frequent_implementation.ipynb
6. iterative_implementation.ipynb
7. KNN_implementation.ipynb
